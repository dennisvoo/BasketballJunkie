# Basketball Junkie
Basketball Junkie is an alternative to the NBA website that allows users to view games, box scores, standings, and team stats, among other
features.

## Features
Users will view the games for the day on the home page along with a jumbotron scoreboard at the top of the page. They can click
on an individual game card's button to view the box score for that game. The Navbar also features a standings and team stats page.

## Making An Account
Users can operate as a guest but registering allows for additional features. Making an account will allow the user to store
their favorite team as well as preferences for what game the jumbotron will display. In order, the user can select their
favorite team's game, games between MVP candidates, nationally televised games, and games between teams with a playoff seeding.
